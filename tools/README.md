To spawn ants for existing records do the following:

- `node spawn-ants-for-records.mjs --testnet --dry-run --file <path-to-csv-file>` - confirm the total number of process ids that will be created
- `node spawn-ants-for-records.mjs --testnet --file <path-to-csv-file>` - spawn the ants, this will update the file. If errors occur, re-run and it will resume from where it left off.
